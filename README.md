## Using this Repository

Feel free to look around and get inspiration from the game's source code. We would also appreciate outside contributions.
That's fine. But please don't upload the game as a new title to the Google Play Store, or any other app store or website, 
even if you've made some changes. Do not charge money for this source code, or any project using this source code.

Thanks!
